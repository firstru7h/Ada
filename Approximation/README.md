Approximation
-------------------
This program will approximate floating point values as the sum of (negative) powers of 
two, up to some limit. Your program will input any number of ordered pairs of numbers 
(x, y). 
A pair is valid if:
x is a number greater than 0.0 and less than 1.0, 
and
y is a positive integer less than 40.
For each valid pair it will produce output that shows
1. (x, y)
2. how to approximate x as the sum of powers of 2 from -1 down to -y,
3. the size of any error in the approximation,
4. a message indicating whether x and its approximation are equal.
